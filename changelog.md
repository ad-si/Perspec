## 2020-02-23 - [0.1.1.0](https://github.com/ad-si/Perspec/releases/tag/v0.1.1.0)

This is basically a MVP release.
I've used it to correct hundreds of images,
so it works and is already quite useful, but there are a few limitations:

- ImageMagick is not bundled and must therefore be installed globally
- Due to a [render bug of gloss] the initial view is a little broken
    and one needs to rescale the window to force a redraw
